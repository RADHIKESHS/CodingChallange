Question:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

---Key things for API security and reliability:

Auth: 			Secure endpoints using tokens (JWT/OAuth2).
Validation: 		Sanitize inputs to avoid attacks.
HTTPS: 			Always encrypt communication(Every request need jwt token in header).
Error Handling: 	Use proper status codes, give clear errors.
Versioning: 		Keep backward compatibility with versioning.
Timeouts/Retries: 	Set timeouts to avoid hanging, retry failed calls.
RestTemplate: 		Use for making GET/POST requests and configure timeouts.
